1. Finding mother vertex in a graph(vertex which has a path to every other vertex): 
  a)Naive approach: using bfs or dfs this takes O(V(V+E)) time.
  b)using Kosaraju’s Strongly Connected Component Algorithm in O(V+E).
2. Kosaraju’s Strongly Connected Component Algorithm O(V+E): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/ please see this link for explanation. It is explained in depth.
